            <h1>Elizabeth J. Traut, Ph.D.</h1>
            <p><strong>Assistant Research Professor</strong><br/>
                Larson Transportation Institute, Penn State</p>
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>I am an assistant research professor with the <a href="https://www.larson.psu.edu/">Larson Transportation
                Institute</a> in the <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">Penn State</a>
                <a href="https://www.engr.psu.edu/">College of Engineering</a>. My research on sustainable
                transportation uses modeling and optimization to evaluate tradeoffs in design and policy decisions for
                transportation systems.  My research interests include public transit, electric vehicles, charging
                infrastructure, connected and autonomous vehicles, travel behavior data analysis, economic and
                statistical modeling of transportation systems, and life cycle assessment.  I have experience analyzing
                travel behavior data and infrastructure data, combining data sets, selecting and fitting models and
                metamodels, optimizing transportation systems, performing life cycle assessment (LCA), and working with
                Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for both geospatial analysis and visualization. I have worked with
                traditional data (surveys) and nontraditional data (GPS traces, crowdsourcing).</p>

            <h2>Latest Updates</h2>
            <p><strong>08/15/2018</strong> I am pleased to announce that I have joined Penn State as an assistant
                research professor in the Larson Transportation Institute.</p>
            <h2>Research Experience</h2>
            <h3>Postdoctoral Researcher with RERC-APT</h3>
            <p>As a postdoctoral researcher with the <a href="http://www.rercapt.org/">Rehabilitation Engineering
                Research Center on Accessible Public Transportation (RERC-APT)</a> in the <a
                    href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">Robotics Institute at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon
                University</a>, I analyzed crowdsourced data from the mobile transit app Tiramisu to identify travel
                patterns for planning sustainable transit and urban infrastructure.</p>
            <h3>NSF SEES Fellowship</h3>
            <p>As a <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504673">Science, Engineering, and Education
                for Sustainability Fellow</a>, funded by the US National Science Foundation, I took an interdisciplinary
                approach to understanding the potential benefits of electric vehicles in urban areas. I performed
                research towards identifying desirable regional scenarios of electric vehicles and charging
                infrastructure by determining the impacts of existing land use patterns and public transit availability
                on life cycle cost and emissions of electric vehicle systems, including charging infrastructure. I held
                a dual position as a postdoctoral researcher in Urban Studies at the University of Glasgow and in
                Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. My research mentors were
                <a href="http://vonuthakuriah.com/">Piyushimita (Vonu) Thakuriah</a>, in Urban Studies at the
                <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/">University of Glasgow</a>, and
                <a href="http://www.ce.cmu.edu/~cth/">Chris Hendrickson</a>, in Civil and Environmental Engineering at
                <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. The award abstract is available on the
                NSF's web site
                <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1313934">here</a>.</p>
            <h3>PhD Research</h3>
            <p>My PhD dissertation work examined tradeoffs between electrified vehicle design and deployment of
                charging infrastructure, including implications for life cycle cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and fuel
                consumption
                of personal vehicles. Methods included life cycle cost and GHG emissions modeling of electrified
                vehicles and infrastructure for slow-charging, fast-charging, and battery swapping; developing scenarios
                of electrified vehicle adoption and charging availability; optimizing those scenarios with respect to
                electrified vehicle design parameters and charging infrastructure deployment; and examining the
                implications for policy and for engineering design and consumer adoption of plug-in hybrid electric
                vehicles and pure electric vehicles. My PhD research advisors were
                <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/me/ddl/jmichalek/">Jeremy J. Michalek</a> and <a
                        href="http://www.ce.cmu.edu/~cth/">Chris Hendrickson</a>.</p>
            <h3>Prior Research</h3>
            <p>Prior to my PhD work, my research projects included work on solar thermal absorption refrigeration at the
                University of Zaragoza in Zaragoza, Spain (2006); work with a PEM fuel cell at the Center for
                Intelligent Material Systems and Structures at Virginia Tech (2005-2006); and an NSF REU project on
                technology and policy in sustainable road transportation decisions at Southern University and A&amp;M
                College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana (2005).</p>
